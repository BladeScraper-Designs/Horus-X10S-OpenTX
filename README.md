# Horus X10S OpenTX
This repository contains the SD Card contents from my Horus X10S with OpenTX.  It can be used as a reference or base for setting up your own models.  It also contains the .otx file for Companion 2.2.4 with my models and settings.



LOGO 480 XXtreme Model contains the Lua script necessary for Brain2 OpenTX Integration.




Settings changed from stock OpenTX:

-Splash Screen Changed

-Radio Background Changed

-Theme Color Changed from Red to Black

-Removed most default images, since they were not useful to me, and especially not for helis :)


Follow these steps in order to copy one of my models onto your radio (click image for higher quality):

1. Download the x10s.otx file from here.  

2. Open the Companion 2.2 software.

3. Connect your OpenTX radio to your computer.

4. Click the "Read Models and Settings From Radio" in Companion.  This will create an otx tile of your radio called document1.otx.  If you already have one, you can open it.
