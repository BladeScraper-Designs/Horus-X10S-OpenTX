# Horus X10S OpenTX
This repository contains the SD Card contents from my Horus X10S with OpenTX.  It can be used as a reference or base for setting up your own models.



LOGO 480 XXtreme Model contains the Lua script necessary for Brain2 OpenTX Integration.




Settings changed from stock OpenTX:

-Splash Screen Changed

-Radio Background Changed

-Theme Color Changed from Red to Black

-Removed most default images, since they were not useful to me, and especially not for helis :)
